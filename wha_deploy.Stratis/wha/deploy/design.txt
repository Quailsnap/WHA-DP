Design Doc: WH Deploy
This thing's brand new. Bear with me.
======================
v0.0.1/v0.0.2 <-- Current
- System can be turned on and off with a variable.
- Functions are compiled within init.
- Add deploy function to group leader if not already present.
- Fade all group members to black, teleport to location.
- Remove action from group leader.

v0.1.1
- Make sure ground / sea vehicles deploy properly. (DONE)
- Implement new canDeploy function.
- Action will not be added unless canDeploy.
- Detect mission type for canDeploy.
- Detect if Safestart is on for canDeploy, ie -- JIP cannot deploy.
- Only add action once Safestart has ended. ( !potato_safestart_enabled )
- Add HALO option with configurable height.
- Disperse players randomly in a radius upon deploy to avoid colliding. (DONE)
- Change dispersion depending on number of players / vehicle in group with new function.
- Change hints to use prettier ACE structured text.
- If markers of a certain name are present, players may only deploy within those markers.

Current Issues:
- Players can deploy into rock props.
- (Can't reproduce?) players deploying exactly on a coastline die.
- Passengers in a vehicle being deployed are not alerted that the vehicle will teleport.
- Vehicle with multiple members of the same group inside will teleport multiple times.
